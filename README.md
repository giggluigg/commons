If you used this code, happen to be/live in Amsterdam and want to go for beers, I'm in. But if we do, you pay.

I put my best effort to keep the javadocs clean and the code readable, therefore I'm relying on them as the official source of documentation.
If you think I did not succeed in my intent, please let me know and we will fix it.
